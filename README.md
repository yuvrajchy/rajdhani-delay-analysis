# Rajdhani Express Delay Analysis 🚆

## Overview
This project analyzes **Rajdhani Express train delays** using real-world Indian Railways data.

The goal is to understand **delay patterns, peak delay periods, and high-risk routes** through structured data analysis and visualization.

This project demonstrates practical experience in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation** using Python.

---

## Objective
- Analyze historical Rajdhani Express delay data  
- Identify delay trends across **routes, time periods, and regions**  
- Extract actionable insights highlighting **operational inefficiencies**

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available Indian Railways delay data  
- **Format:** CSV files  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
