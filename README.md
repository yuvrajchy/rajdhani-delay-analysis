Rajdhani Express Delay Analysis 🚆
Overview

This project analyzes Rajdhani Express train delays using real-world Indian Railways data.
The goal is to understand delay patterns, peak delay periods, and high-risk routes through data analysis and visualization.

The project demonstrates practical data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation using Python.

Objective

Analyze historical Rajdhani Express delay data

Identify delay trends across routes, time periods, and regions

Extract actionable insights that highlight operational inefficiencies

Dataset

Source: Publicly available Indian Railways delay data

Format: CSV files

Contents include:

Train routes

Delay duration

Date and time information

Station-level details

Dataset files are stored in the data/ directory.

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Version Control: Git & GitHub


Methodology

Data Cleaning

Removed inconsistencies and handled missing values

Standardized date/time formats

Prepared analysis-ready datasets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed delay distribution across routes

Studied delay patterns by time and region

Compared peak vs non-peak delay periods

Visualization

Created clear plots to highlight delay trends

Used charts to support data-driven conclusions

Key Insights

Certain routes consistently experience higher average delays

Delays increase significantly during specific time windows

Route-level analysis reveals high-risk corridors prone to operational inefficiencies

Results

The analysis provides a clear view of:

Where delays are most frequent

When delays are most severe

Which routes need operational attention

These insights can support planning, scheduling, and optimization decisions.

Future Improvements

Add predictive modeling to estimate expected delays

Incorporate weather and seasonal data

Build a simple dashboard for interactive analysis
